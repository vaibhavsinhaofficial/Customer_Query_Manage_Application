# Bankconnect HRIS | View Project

Developed a web application for Bankconnect, a payment gateway company, to help Business Developers (BDs) track their incentives based on merchant transactions and success rates.

Integrated Google applications (Calendar, Meetings, Google Keep) to fetch schedules, meetings, and notes directly within the platform.

Integrated Slack to streamline communicationâ€”no need to switch between apps. Just open Bankconnect HRIS and access everything in one place.

Managers can also track employee statistics such as total working hours, leave records, and project performance through the application.
